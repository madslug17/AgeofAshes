I earn 7 SP eating garbage and I find some nice boar fats and meats that I smoke and mix with salt and citric acid and jar with flour, water, carrot root, onion stem, celery nub, black pepper, rosemary stems, and potato peels. 4 x jars. I also find some old malt that I mix with my jar of wild yeast, sugar, and some of the rosemary stems to re-extract and barrel into beer.

Fable attempts to steal from Trini (Councilmember). Gets caught by Trini and he notices she saved people from the fire and lets it slide. Gets 1 GP and 4SP (She shares 1 SP per person)

Hal sneaks in to the storage room and finds Trini as he’s leaving after trying to leave money. Trini knows that Hal is bleaching ( Aging quickly ).

**We sleep for the night**

Store. Halfling asking if we need to buy anything for the exorbitant price of 4 GP per potion


*En Route to Hellknight Hill*

**2.5 miles North of Breachill.**

## Hellknight Hill Exterior
Doors ajar to Hellknight Hill. Not surprising since it is abandoned except by the Bramblebashers.

Need to go inside to go to top of citadel. We climb the brambles surrounding Hellknight Hill to get up into the citadel.

Met  Hell Knight from Order of the First Nail. Armiger Alak Stagram was injured by Imps in the Citadel. Order of the First Nail typically worships Asmodeus. I healed him and he heads back to breachill. His signet ring is missing. Hal said he will find it.

 - 260   Total

# Session 2:

## Hellknight Hill Interior

We enter the citadel and find a room with training dummies. We see a storage room through a crack that only an imp can go through. We enter the room to the left and there is a pentagram with the 3 imps that Armiger slayed.

We go back through the training room and search another room that contains a spider swarm.
### The room contains the following loot
 - 2 x antidote ingredients
 - 2 x arsenic

We defeat 1 Imp, and one runs away and turns into a rat. Fable gives me spider corpses because she is intrigued by my trash diet. It probably reminds her of Marty.

We leave and find a room with mold which I eat and goes airborne when other people enter the room. We find in the room:
1 x Silver Dagger
5 x Questionable rations

We bump into the training dummies and they leak silver pieces. We find:
25 x Silver Pieces

We continue through the Imp room and happen upon a courtyard. There is a halfling clutching a Goblin. It is Calmont.

We enter the courtyard. we try and negotiate with him while noticing the Growledon in the pond in the courtyard. Calmont flees to the battlements above the courtyard.

Fable tries to persuade him since she knows him from around town. He calls us do-gooders.

Hal tries to persuade him. He says there is an Elf gate under this building and he needs to know how to get there from the Goblins. He lets go of the Goblin and we enter combat!

We almost kill Calmont and party with the Goblins. The goblins praise me and Asemer for our heroics and Hal talks to Helba, the Chieftain of the Bramblebashers. She knows nothing of the Elves, but was surprised when the Imps attacked. The cult is called the Cinderclaws and they  summoned the imps. They ran up here to escape the Imps, Dragon-dogs, and other Hellbeasts. 

### Calmont Loot:
 - Shortbow
 - Leather Armor
 - Dagger
 - Thieve's Tools

Hal finds out the Growledon are the large-sized crushed dragons littering the courtyard. Not intelligent enough to form societies. They are not wildly beyond our capabilities.

Helba knows about the downstairs, but never got the chance to tell Calmont about it. Growledon's blocked the downstairs, but Helba knows of a secret passage. We'll clear the downstairs and then Helba will guide us down. We'll break in Breachill while the Bramblebashers stay on the outskirts.

### Session 2 XP:
 - 60     Spider Swarm
 - 40     Imp
 - 20     Gray Mold (Pantry)
 - 80     Capture Calmont
 - 200   Total

# Session 3:

We are in the citadel with the manacled Calmont. It is mid-afternoon.

## Hellknight Citadel Interior
Gus gives me a large cigar and I cough while inhaling it. We leave Calmont manacled with the Bramblebashers. We go back into the courtyard, disturb the water and a growledon comes out. COMBAT!

Fable slices the head of the Growledon off to end the combat.

I can harvest **meat** from this bad boy. Gus gets some Growledon hide and I get 5 rations.

We get our malignity of goblins and start to head out when we spy an opened door... Gus puts a bench in front of it and we leave for Breachill.

## Breachill
The Bramblebashers hail us as heroes, specifically Mo and Asemer. They set up camp outside of Breachill. We arrive at dusk and find out the council members are still working at Breachill Town Hall (3)

### Breachill Town Hall
People are starting to head home, but we find Greta Gardenia and Trini leading repairs on the Town Hall. Hal is boistrously telling everyone that the heroes of Breachill have returned. 

We hand over Calmont and tell Greta the Bramblebashers are safe.

#### Quest Loot:
 - 20 GP

Greta proclaims us Breachill heroes and we get discounts at the stores! We schedule a debrief meeting with the council.

#### We split the loot money into 5 SP and 4 GP and sell the following:
 - Calmont's Leather armor 5 SP each

Trini describes a treasure hunt to Hal who goes on it? **Ask Tyler for details**

Gus and I party with the Bramblebashers and Helba informs us of the secret passage to the lower levels.

### We sleep for the night

### Breachill Town Hall

We go to Quintino and Greta and talk about the Elf Gate and the Growledons and such. in the Citadel. Alak is there and Hal talks him up even though he's evil... Greta is surprised there are Hellknights in the area again.

#### Quarantino gives us loot:
 - 2 minor helaing potions

### Quarters and Bits

#### Gus sells the Growledon hide and gets us each some loot:
 - 1 GP each

The growledon hide is not resistant to fire.

## Hellknight Hill Exterior
We treat it as out first time here since it has been so long. The Bramblebashers stay at Breachill until we clear out the tower.

## Hellknight Hill Interior
Gus knows that it is home to many creatures that typically peacefully co-exist, but The Cinderclaws have upset that co-habitual order. We see that the doors have moved since we were last here and can assume someone has been here since we left.

The party re-searches the rooms while Hal and Mo lay low. Everything is as we left it.

### Lecture Hall
We find some Order of the Nail insignias crumpled up and disorderly. These are worn by Recruits of the Order of the Nail known as Armigers. These would be valuable to the Order of the Nail members.

*Armigers put silver in dummies when they are naughty*

### Barracks
A yolecha throws a spear at me and we start combat!
I'm dying. Gus and I heal myself.

The yolechas were bugbears. They probably preceded the Cinderclaws, but there is a slim chacne that they are aligned with them.

#### Bugbear Loot:
 - Bastard Sword - Gus
 - 3 Javelins - go to Gus and Fable

#### Barracks loot:
 - Lesser tanglefoot bag - Mo
 - Lesser bottled lightning - Mo
 - Minor healing potion - Asemer
 - Wolfsbane talisman - Asemer
 - 2 flasks of holy water - Gus and Fable

### Corridor 1
Pictures of Hellknights I do not recognize

### Citadel Foyer
Lined with statues of Hellknights and in the corner we see three goblin dogs that are concerned with eating garbage. We feed them some Growledon meat and find they are itchy so we try and alleviate their pain. We cannot and we find nothing of note in the foyer.

### Court Room
In rubble. There is a corpse in silverly armor in the puddle pooling into the room. We search the room and we do not find anything of note. Gus goes to inspect the corpse and large spikes jut out from the water and impale Gus. A Graveshell emerges from the pool. Combat!

#### Loot:
 - Chain Shirt on corpse - Gus
 - 7 GP on corpse - Split
 - 6 SP in room - Split
 - Scroll of alarm in room - Hal
 - Scroll of fear - Hal

I find Worg nests. They must be in the area. Gus knows they can eat small size creatures whole.

### Library
Books had broken tables litter the room. Order of the Nail is not evil. They are head-quartered in Varisia and work for the queen. They are all required to worship Asmodeus. They abandoned the Citadel decades ago. When they came to Isger they came to bring law and order to a wild nation. They no longer have control of this region.

#### Book in Library
"To Lecter Assilimar, Thanks for helping me quell that savagery. Signed Hellknight P Stagram Esq."

Gus channels and kills skellies before they even rise. Fable and I pick a lock for an hour and finally get it open.

# Session 4

## Hellknight Hill Interior

### Clerk's Office
We enter and Gus spies a giant bat with a 15 foot wingspan hanging from the ceiling. He approaches it peacefully. Combat! A worg and an Imp enter the fray! We kill all of them but the Imp whom me tie up with some rope. The worgs eyes light on fire and burn out. This means something. The imp says, "All hail Asmodeus!" and tries to cast a spell. Gus promptly beheads it. Gus puts the heads in a sack in the corner of the office.

### Record Room
We enter and immediately fight three rats. Combat! They dead.

#### Room Loot:
 - Mound of meat - Mo'
 - Wild Blackberries - Mo'

### Larder
We find rotten food mounds and worg nests. Gus knows that the burning eyes are not typically a Worg trait.

We move through an empty column room, hallway, and staging area to a hidden door.

### Secret Corridor
A spear impales Fable who was tra-la-la-ing down the hallway. A 34 to hit doing 22 damage. Holy shit. Gus heals her.

### Secret Imp Room
A devil room with texts and reagents for summoning devils.

 - Silver shortsword

**Level Up!**
