# Session 1

Go to call of heroes

## Town Hall

 Fire Mephits intrude. Fire happens. We kill Mephits and put out fires. Calmont was seen starting fires in the Town Hall. Greta Gardenia is a councilwoman who thanks us. She runs Call of Heroes. Warble of the Bramblebrashers was about to speak. Calmont was heading to Hellknight Hill (Home of the Bramblebrashers. 10G to meet with Bramblebrashers. 10GPs to bring Calmont back alive. Calmont was a store-hand at the Reliant Book Company.

Guard: Vox has been on leave for a week according to the neighbour on the right.

Calmont’s Journal: Illegible… He states he was not well treated.

Hal finds out fire mephits can be summoned.

## Shelly’s Abode

Neighbor of Vox.
Shelly: Vox on vacation for a week. Received coin from Vox to watch over Bookstore. Calmont and Vox had unstable relationship. Calmont complained of Vox ordering him around. Spoke directly to Vox regarding vacation. Calmont seemed unstable.

## Wizard’s Grace

I earn 7 SP eating garbage and I find some nice boar fats and meats that I smoke and mix with salt and citric acid and jar with flour, water, carrot root, onion stem, celery nub, black pepper, rosemary stems, and potato peels. 4 x jars. I also find some old malt that I mix with my jar of wild yeast, sugar, and some of the rosemary stems to re-extract and barrel into beer.

1 SP for boar stew.

Fable attempts to steal from Trini (Councilmember). Gets caught by Trini and he notices she saved people from the fire and lets it slide. Gets 1 GP and 4SP (She shares 1 SP per person)

Hal sneaks in to the storage room and finds Trini as he’s leaving after trying to leave money. Trini knows that Hal is bleaching ( Aging quickly ).

Asamer eats stew.

Gus tries to corral everyone into pulling an all-nighter. Does so and gets infor for us to go to Quarters and Bits.

**We sleep for the night**

## Quarters and Bits

### We are given for free

- 1 x manacles
- 1 x Climbing Kit
- 2 x Minor Healing Potions

Store. Halfling asking if we need to buy anything for the exorbitant price of 4 GP per potion

*En Route to Hellknight Hill*

**2.5 miles North of Breachill.**

## Hellknight Hill Exterior

Doors ajar to Hellknight Hill. Not surprising since it is abandoned except by the Bramblebashers.

Need to go inside to go to top of citadel. We climb the brambles surrounding Hellknight Hill to get up into the citadel.

Met  Hell Knight from Order of the First Nail. Armiger Alak Stagram was injured by Imps in the Citadel. Order of the First Nail typically worships Asmodeus. I healed him and he heads back to breachill. His signet ring is missing. Hal said he will find it.

- 260   Total

# Session 2

## Hellknight Hill Interior

We enter the citadel and find a room with training dummies. We see a storage room through a crack that only an imp can go through. We enter the room to the left and there is a pentagram with the 3 imps that Armiger slayed.

We go back through the training room and search another room that contains a spider swarm.

### The room contains the following loot

- 2 x antidote ingredients
- 2 x arsenic

We defeat 1 Imp, and one runs away and turns into a rat. Fable gives me spider corpses because she is intrigued by my trash diet. It probably reminds her of Marty.

We leave and find a room with mold which I eat and goes airborne when other people enter the room. We find in the room:
1 x Silver Dagger
5 x Questionable rations

We bump into the training dummies and they leak silver pieces. We find:
25 x Silver Pieces

We continue through the Imp room and happen upon a courtyard. There is a halfling clutching a Goblin. It is Calmont.

We enter the courtyard. we try and negotiate with him while noticing the Growledon in the pond in the courtyard. Calmont flees to the battlements above the courtyard.

Fable tries to persuade him since she knows him from around town. He calls us do-gooders.

Hal tries to persuade him. He says there is an Elf gate under this building and he needs to know how to get there from the Goblins. He lets go of the Goblin and we enter combat!

We almost kill Calmont and party with the Goblins. The goblins praise me and Asemer for our heroics and Hal talks to Helba, the Chieftain of the Bramblebashers. She knows nothing of the Elves, but was surprised when the Imps attacked. The cult is called the Cinderclaws and they  summoned the imps. They ran up here to escape the Imps, Dragon-dogs, and other Hellbeasts.

### Calmont Loot

- Shortbow
- Leather Armor
- Dagger
- Thieves' Tools

Hal finds out the Growledon are the large-sized crushed dragons littering the courtyard. Not intelligent enough to form societies. They are not wildly beyond our capabilities.

Helba knows about the downstairs, but never got the chance to tell Calmont about it. Growledon's blocked the downstairs, but Helba knows of a secret passage. We'll clear the downstairs and then Helba will guide us down. We'll break in Breachill while the Bramblebashers stay on the outskirts.

### Session 2 XP

- 40     Imp
- 20     Gray Mold (Pantry)
- 80     Capture Calmont
- 200   Total

# Session 3

We are in the citadel with the manacled Calmont. It is mid-afternoon.

## Hellknight Citadel Interior

Gus gives me a large cigar and I cough while inhaling it. We leave Calmont manacled with the Bramblebashers. We go back into the courtyard, disturb the water and a growledon comes out. COMBAT!

Fable slices the head of the Growledon off to end the combat.

I can harvest **meat** from this bad boy. Gus gets some Growledon hide and I get 5 rations.

We get our malignity of goblins and start to head out when we spy an opened door... Gus puts a bench in front of it and we leave for Breachill.

## Breachill

The Bramblebashers hail us as heroes, specifically Mo and Asemer. They set up camp outside of Breachill. We arrive at dusk and find out the council members are still working at Breachill Town Hall (3)

### Breachill Town Hall

People are starting to head home, but we find Greta Gardenia and Trini leading repairs on the Town Hall. Hal is boisterously telling everyone that the heroes of Breachill have returned.

We hand over Calmont and tell Greta the Bramblebashers are safe.

#### Quest Loot

- 20 GP

Greta proclaims us Breachill heroes and we get discounts at the stores! We schedule a debrief meeting with the council.

#### We split the loot money into 5 SP and 4 GP and sell the following

- Calmont's Leather armor 5 SP each

Trini describes a treasure hunt to Hal to lead to treasures hidden by Lamond Breachton. She described the book and page. An infrastructure book and the page describes attractions around the town. Hal must go on this hunt to find Lamond's treasures.

Gus and I party with the Bramblebashers and Helba informs us of the secret passage to the lower levels.

### We sleep for the night

### Breachill Town Hall

We go to Quintino and Greta and talk about the Elf Gate and the Growledons and such. in the Citadel. Alak is there and Hal talks him up even though he's evil... Greta is surprised there are Hellknights in the area again.

#### Quarantino gives us loot

- 2 minor helaing potions

### Quarters and Bits

#### Gus sells the Growledon hide and gets us each some loot

- 1 GP each

The growledon hide is not resistant to fire.

## Hellknight Hill Exterior

We treat it as out first time here since it has been so long. The Bramblebashers stay at Breachill until we clear out the tower.

## Hellknight Hill Interior

Gus knows that it is home to many creatures that typically peacefully co-exist, but The Cinderclaws have upset that co-habitual order. We see that the doors have moved since we were last here and can assume someone has been here since we left.

The party re-searches the rooms while Hal and Mo lay low. Everything is as we left it.

### Lecture Hall

We find some Order of the Nail insignias crumpled up and disorderly. These are worn by Recruits of the Order of the Nail known as Armigers. These would be valuable to the Order of the Nail members.

*Armigers put silver in dummies when they are naughty*

### Barracks

A yolecha throws a spear at me and we start combat!
I'm dying. Gus and I heal myself.

The yolechas were bugbears. They probably preceded the Cinderclaws, but there is a slim chance that they are aligned with them.

#### Bugbear Loot

- Bastard Sword - Gus
- 3 Javelins - go to Gus and Fable

#### Barracks loot

- Lesser tanglefoot bag - Mo
- Lesser bottled lightning - Mo
- Minor healing potion - Asemer
- Wolfsbane talisman - Asemer
- 2 flasks of holy water - Gus and Fable

### Corridor 1

Pictures of Hellknights I do not recognize

### Citadel Foyer

Lined with statues of Hellknights and in the corner we see three goblin dogs that are concerned with eating garbage. We feed them some Growledon meat and find they are itchy so we try and alleviate their pain. We cannot and we find nothing of note in the foyer.

### Court Room

In rubble. There is a corpse in silvery armor in the puddle pooling into the room. We search the room and we do not find anything of note. Gus goes to inspect the corpse and large spikes jut out from the water and impale Gus. A Graveshell emerges from the pool. Combat!

#### Loot

- Chain Shirt on corpse - Gus
- 7 GP on corpse - Split
- 6 SP in room - Split
- Scroll of alarm in room - Hal
- Scroll of fear - Hal

I find Worg nests. They must be in the area. Gus knows they can eat small size creatures whole.

### Library

Books had broken tables litter the room. Order of the Nail is not evil. They are head-quartered in Varisia and work for the queen. They are all required to worship Asmodeus. They abandoned the Citadel decades ago. When they came to Isger they came to bring law and order to a wild nation. They no longer have control of this region.

#### Book in Library

"To Lector Assilimar, Thanks for helping me quell that savagery. Signed Hellknight P Stagram Esq."

Gus channels and kills skellies before they even rise. Fable and I pick a lock for an hour and finally get it open.

# Session 4

## Hellknight Hill Interior

### Clerk's Office

We enter and Gus spies a giant bat with a 15 foot wingspan hanging from the ceiling. He approaches it peacefully. Combat! A worg and an Imp enter the fray! We kill all of them but the Imp whom me tie up with some rope. The worgs eyes light on fire and burn out. This means something. The imp says, "All hail Asmodeus!" and tries to cast a spell. Gus promptly beheads it. Gus puts the heads in a sack in the corner of the office.

### Record Room

We enter and immediately fight three rats. Combat! They dead.

#### Room Loot

- Mound of meat - Mo'
- Wild Blackberries - Mo'

We find rotten food mounds and worg nests. Gus knows that the burning eyes are not typically a Worg trait.

We move through an empty column room, hallway, and staging area to a hidden door.

### Dungeon Hall #1

We find Boggards who we attack because they looked threatening. We tie them up and I fix Gus's shield. Red cloth is symbol of Galak the dragon god on the Boggards' shoulders. They babble in Boggard and Gus decapitates them. This room belonged to the Bramblebashers.

# Session 5

## Hellknight Interior

### Dungeon Hallway 2

We enter the room and there is a cowering boggard. Asemar rushes in to attack, misses every hit, and starts a dialogue regarding the boggard's terms of surrender. Gus and Fable echo this by intimidating him. We kill him and inspect the room. There is old furniture abound.

We proceed north to a crack and peer through. A large bear is eating the bodies of monkey and frog people. Hal goes to get a glimpse and finds that the monkey people are not within his scope of knowledge. Mo' recognizes them as Charau-ka, ape-men of the Mwangi Expanse. We pull the boggard out of the way and find a barricaded door that the boggard and we cannot get through. We go south back to the main hall.

### Main Corridor

We take a 10 minute break to heal up and refocus. Mo' finds slime that goes from the top farthest stairway to the bottom door at the end of the main hall. He describes the taste to fable as a sweaty acidic vinegar-y flavor that could be refined into a nice taste.

### Dungeon Hallway 3

We go north to a door that Fable can't open. She beckons Asemer to try and he cannot go through because it is barred. Hal and Fable fist-bump. Asemer pries the door open with his bo staff and we encounter 4 Charau-ka. **Combat!**

Gus attempts to imtimidate. The Charau-ka respond threateningly in Mwangi. We kill 3 and chase the remaining into the next room. We follow them and encounter a boggard who waps me with his tongue. I poison him good and chase him into the adjoining bedroom where we kill him and the rest of the apes.

### Bedroom

Full of garbage. There are goblin jokes on the wall. They. Are. Awful.

#### Room Loot

- 15 GP - Gus
- Staff - Left in room
- Furniture

Gus heals everyone 17 and we go back to towen to rest.

## Breachill

We arrive midday.

### Quarters and Bits

The halfling greets us as we enter. We get 5% off for being town heroes. Fable charms him and he doubles it to 10%.

#### Bought Items

- 2 minor healing potions - Asemer
- lesser healing potion - Fable

### Hal's Trini Treasure Hunt

#### Monument Circle

Hall inspects every nook and cranny of the gray bronze statue of Lamond Breachton. Finds nothing. He climbs the statue and touches an orb he detects magic on, drawing attention from the townsfolk. He explains it away. The orb is fused to the statue and he cannot remove it. It has permancied light cast on it.

#### Town Hall

Examines the ENTIRE exterior of town hall to figure out what Trini was talking about. Finds nothing.

### Fable, Mo', and Asemer's Caper

The Posandi Bros. are bad news and they need to rob them. Fable knows the Posandi Bros. have been here since the Hellknights occupied Breachill. Everyone who works there is familial with the Posandi Bros. Quintino is the figure head of the Posandi Bros. The higher ranking officials treat Fable well, but the laborers (Stonemasons) bully fable because her step-dad owns Tuskhead Stoneworking, which encroaches on Posandi Bros. territory.

We arrive at night. We try and pick the lock and get in so we can sabotage. Fable fails twice.

Mo' makes an underworld lore (27) on the Posandi Bros. Quintino is smart and good at problem-solving. They are unreasonable lucky and shrewd, so they are probably into shady shit.

Mo' pours acid on it. It weakens the locks integrity and we break the lock off. Someone is coming so Mo' slings a rock in the opposite direction. Asemer breaks into a crate and Fable examines the contents. She can't make it out. I see that it's masonry crafting stuff, but there is some stuff I can't place. Fable grabs some masonry tools, Mo' grabs some of the stuff he could not identify, and Asemer grabs some heavy stuff.

We open one more box with more masonry tools. Asemer identifies supplies identical to those found in a supply room at The Citadel. *Interesting*.

We stealth out unimpeded.

### Gourmet Mo'

#### The Pickled Ear

I gather egg whites from shells, stale bread I pound into bread crumbs, and bacon grease. I fry the spiders in the bacon grease after dredging them.

#### Lamond's Lament

Greta is working there. I serve her some of the Mo' dubbed Arraignees frites. She likes it and I serve at Lamond's Lament to the less fortunate folk of Breachill. I then gather some sling stones.

##### Reward

- Potion of Retaliation, Lesser (Type fire)

### We sleep for the night

## Hellknight Interior

### Common Room

A fallen chandelier lays in the middle of the room. Red curtains are remnants of the Hellknights' previous residence. The barred room is no longer barred and we enter.

### Goblin Bedroom

A puddle drips on wood stuck to flagstone rubble rising up like bizarre foliage. Mo' recognizes it as a Goblin residence. I find loot in the mud puddle.

#### Room Loot

- Invisibility Potion - Mo'

### Main Corridor

We follow the slime trail from the collapsed lower level to the bottom door. Asemer open the door to hallway.

### Painted Corridor

Oil paintings adorn the wall depicting the Hellknights most accomplished deeds. It details the Hellknights conquest of monsters. Mo' notices a painting in better condition still hanging on the wall. It depicts a hellknight fighting on a hill. It's probably worth something. Fable takes the canvas off the frame and pockets it. We go to the door to the North.

### Study

Two monkey bodies are on the floor. A splintered table is in the center with chairs, moldy books, and papers scattered around. A statue of as hellknight is in the center of the room. The statue levitates off the table. Combat!

We kill it and it says, "Take me with you!"

We heal up Asemer. 1 elixir of life, treat wounds, 2 healing spells.
We heal Gus. 2 elixirs of life.

# Session 6

## Hellknight  Hill Interior

### West Hallway from Study

We open the door and Asemar walks inside a slime. Combat! Sneaks and crits don't work, but poison do.

#### Room Loot

- +1 Bastard Sword

After an hour, Gus has used treat wounds on everyone. Hal gets antsy sitting still for so long. I offer him a Gettin' Trashed IPA, he does not like it but is a good sport about it. I offer some to everyone else and we cheers over the dead slime. We notice that Hal has scales that have been getting worse.

### Smithy

We find enough armor to piece together one set of Hellknight Armor, anvils, and degraded weapons.

#### Room Loot

- Hellknight Plate - Gus

### Study

We return back to the study and attempt a barricaded door. We try the upper west door.

### Empty room

The door to the West returns to the main corridor.

### Main Corridor

We go through the South Eastern door.

### Tomb

There are 7 skellies and a big skelly. There is a final resting place for Hellknights. We find bodies lain to rest with some conspicuously empty spaces.

#### Room Loot

Four tombs with important hellknights. There names are on their tombs.

#### Hellknights buried here

- Mistress of blades Xera Delphine

- Paralictor Loren Sinelle

Hal sneaks through the door to the North and discovers two Kobolds eating the Emperor birds in the Main Corridor. 

### Main Corridor

There are two Kobolds eating the emperor birds. Mo' tries to be diplomatic and addresses them as friends, but they say "We're not friends, we're dragons!" Combat!

One escaped, after summoning two illusions.

We gather the paintings and armor and go back to Breachill.

## Breachill

### Quarters and Bits

Gus sells off our excess loot to divvy up amongst the group.

Everyone gets 12GP

Mo' and Hus fully heal two sets of Hellknight fullplate! We sell them for 10GP and a set of fullplate armor for Gus. Gus sells his Breastplate for 4GP and adds 1GP to the group loot.

### Shelyn's Smile

Asemer, and Fable go to sell the Obsidian figurines and the painting.

Armiger Alak just happens to be in the store.

Alak buys the painting for 15GP and the figurines for 20GP.

Quintino also happens to be in the store and Fable pickpockets him and gets some junk. He wants any Hellknight junk we find in the citadel. Alak is staying with Quintino's house. Alak was turned down boarding due to his Hellknight armor and Quintino took him in.

### Hal meanders around the city

He finds himself passing the Pickled Ear, Morta's Mortuary, and Breach Creek Lumber. Lumberjacks are struggling with goblin's at the edge of the Crimsontide Wood getting in the way and chicken monsters deeper in the fwood who have invaded their lumber harvesting locations. Hal also finds a bounty for the chicken monster at Breach Creek.

A tradesman mentions they've lost some people to the chicken monster, and that they can use help. Hal says the Halcyon Brigade may get to it after our current affairs.

These Devil Chickens have been turning people to stone.

## Hellknight Hill Interior

### Tomb

Fable disarms an impaling spike trap on the east door past all the normal Hellknight tombs.

# Session 7

## Hellknight Dungeons

### Tomb

We go back to the dark hallway. Someone used magic to bore out the dirt. It goes on in the direction of Breachill.

### Armory

We go through the study to the northeast and enter the armory. It's clean as if someone had been living there and keeping it up.

We go west through the main corridor to where the bear was.

### Dungeon Hallway 2

The kobold is throwing bodies into the bear room. **COMBAT!**

The kobold yells, "Pibb!" and gets the attention of the other kobold.

We leave the green kobold dying and Pibb surrenders. Hal negotiates in draconic and Pibb is compliant. He tells Hal that he is feeding Bumble the bear. This is his home. Zarf and he have been there since they were little kobolds. They came here and have lived in peace with the Bramblebashers. The boggards and the Charau-ka. The boggards brought the Grouladons with them from the basement up the stairs that are collapsed. Pibb does not know what an Elf Gate is. The bear is the Bramblebashers pet and Pibb was feeding him. Gus recalls the Bramblebashers mentioning Big Bumble the bear.

Gus uses meat and excellent roleplaying to try and lure Big Bumble out of the room. We succeed! We search Bumble's room and there isn't really anything of note. We set Bumble free into the forest. He does the sad look back. The koboolds do the same thing as we send them off to the Bramblebashers.

### Secret Tunnel

We walk for about a mile before we start to see a lantern. Hal and Fable go invisible and scout ahead. Hal sees how perfectly cylindrical the tunnel is and Hal notices a tripwire. By the lantern there are barrels and a desk; basically it's a workstation. Hal casts light on a rock, Fable disables the trap and Hal signals us to come forward. The torch was rigged to drop onto the explosive barrels. The tunnel would have partially caved in. It probably would have been more effective of people were coming from the other direction.

Mo' looks over the workstation and the documents here are owned by Vox.

### Room loot
- Breachill, outposts of liberty book - Mo'
- Map with directions to Entrance to Alesta's Ring -> Guardian's Way - Mo'
- Breachill outposts of secrets book - Mo'
- Scroll of Acid arrow - Hal
- Scroll of False Life - Hal
- Scroll of Obscurring Mist - Hal
- Scroll of Touch Idiocy - Hal

We continue to the end of the tunnel and there is a ladder that leads up to a trapdoor. Asemer proceeds up the ladder and opens the creaky trapdoor. Asemer sees a pantry full of pickled items. Mo' pushes Asmer out of the way and finds cured meats, bread, greasy foods, pickled eggs, carrots, beets, onions, cucumber, pig ears, chicken feet, radishes. We hear tavern music and goblins. I peak out and there are stairs that lead to another door.

Through that door there are two cooks and a waiter notice Mo'. Mo' asks where the bathroom is, and the waiter says he has to go get the manager. Mo' blows a lethargy dart at the waiter and Hal tries to negotiate. Mo' throws a smokestick and yells fire! We storm out with the crowd and run to the other side of Breachill. Roxie notices us run out but goes to tend to her kitchen.

## Breachill

### Wizard's Grace

We walk in nonchalantly, get a hearty boar stew, ales, and talk strategy about confronting Roxie.

### The Pickled Ear

A small crowd has formed in front of The Pickled Ear. Guards are there around the entrance talking to Roxie. Mo' reads her lips and see that she is telling the guard that she wants the Halcyon Brigade to pay for the damages accrued. Halcyon approaches her and says we're here to discuss damages with the guard inside the bar. We go inside and half the crowd clears.

Roxie had no idea that tunnel went to the citadel. Vox had been using it once a week. She had been paying Roxie to use the door. The tunnel had existed there long before she owned this establishment. That is all she knows about the tunnel.

Mo' and Hal confidently believe she is telling the truth. Gus is skeptical. Roxie hasn't seen Vox in over a week.

Mo' drops a gold under the table and notices Roxie has cooking shoes on with no dirt on the soles.

Gus shoots a holy lance through Hal's heart to test he is not evil. He is not. Gus proceeds to check himself, the guards, and then finally Roxie. They are all not evil.

We agree that Mo' will fix the damages, we will address the crowd outside and Roxie is free to state that we endorse her establishment.

Mo' cleans up the establishment with Hal and the other Goblins.

Hal helps and then distracts Roxie so that Mo' can investigate upstairs. He rolls two natural ones and finds no dirt on the stairs. We all head to the Wizard's Grace.

### Wizard's Grace
